                            Engineering. Had a lot of fun while doing my undergrad. Had the opportunity
                            to meet some outstanding people there. My major was communication and minor
                            was electronics. Not totally happy with my CGPA though! Could've done so
                            much better. That's because I was pursuing so many things at the same time
                            like developing programming and software development skills which was outside
                            of my curriculum.
                            People are not good at multi-tasking. Lesson learned indeed!

                            The proposed PCF shows extremely high nonlinearity with very small
